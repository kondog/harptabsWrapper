# harptabsWrapper
[harptabs.com](https://www.harptabs.com/index.php) is pretty good web site
to learn harp tabs.

but search function is not good,
so I want to make more useful search function.

take tabs list from [AllTabs](https://www.harptabs.com/songlist.php?DisplayBy=&MaxFields=23837),
then insert DB.

user can search tabs from page made by Python.
